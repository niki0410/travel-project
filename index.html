            <h2>Why Velaris?</h2>
            <h3>Velaris, the City of Starlight</h3>
            <p>
              Velaris, also known as the Court of Dreams and the City of
              Starlight, is a hidden city on the western side of the Night Court
              of Prythian.
            </p>
            <p>
              Velaris is built like a crust atop rolling, steep hills. The hills
              are flanked by a broad, winding river the color of the deepest
              sapphire, the Sidra River, that snakes across the landscape into
              the sea. The Sidra River has ships with sails of varying shapes
              placed along it permanently, making it navigable. At the northern
              edge of Velaris, curved to where the river bent toward them and
              flowed into their shadows, tower, like eternal guardians of the
              city, a wall of flat-topped mountains of red stone. Their middle
              and larger peak has holes and windows built in the uppermost part
              of it, in fact, there is where the House of Wind, Rhysand's house
              for official business, can be found. To the north are different
              kinds of mountains that surround the city across the river, which
              are a range of sharp peaks comparable to fish teeth cut through
              city's hills from the sea beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city's buildings are crafted out of white marble, warm
              sandstone, and the same red stone of the flat-topped mountains
              that can be found on the northern edge of the city. Many quarters
              of Velaris are full of townhouses with green copper roofs and
              white chimneys.
