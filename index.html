            <h2>Why Velaris?</h2>
            <h3>Velaris, the City of Starlight</h3>
            <p>
              Velaris, also known as the Court of Dreams and the City of
              Starlight, is a hidden city on the western side of the Night Court
              of Prythian.
            </p>
            <p>
              Velaris is built like a crust atop rolling, steep hills. The hills
              are flanked by a broad, winding river the color of the deepest
              sapphire, the Sidra River, that snakes across the landscape into
              the sea. The Sidra River has ships with sails of varying shapes
              placed along it permanently, making it navigable. At the northern
              edge of Velaris, curved to where the river bent toward them and
              flowed into their shadows, tower, like eternal guardians of the
              city, a wall of flat-topped mountains of red stone. Their middle
              and larger peak has holes and windows built in the uppermost part
              of it, in fact, there is where the House of Wind, Rhysand's house
              for official business, can be found. To the north are different
              kinds of mountains that surround the city across the river, which
              are a range of sharp peaks comparable to fish teeth cut through
              city's hills from the sea beyond.

                <p>
                  The Sidra River, or simply known as the Sidra is a broad,
                  winding river sparkling like deepest sapphire that flows
                  through Velaris and sank into the sea gulf of the city. The
                  Sidra is loitered by ships with sails of varying shapes,
                  making it navigable. Two Palaces are located on the southern
                  side of the Sidra and another two on the northern.

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  The Sidra River in Sarah J. Maas's A Court of Thorns and Roses
                  series is more than just a body of water—it's a symbol of
                  freedom and tranquility amidst the vibrant chaos of Velaris.
                  What I love most is how its gentle flow reflects the
                  resilience of the Night Court. The riverbank scenes,
                  especially Feyre's moments of quiet reflection there,
                  highlight the balance between power and peace that Velaris
                  embodies. The Sidra becomes a character in its own right, a
                  constant presence that whispers serenity and renewal, even in
                  a world brimming with danger and magic.

                <h4>Rainbow of Velaris</h4>
                <p>
                  The Rainbow of Velaris is Velaris's artists' quarter, home to
                  the performing artists: the musicians, the dancers, the
                  actors. It is a brightly painted pocket of the city, built
                  atop one of the hills that flowed right to the Sidra River's
                  edge. In the Rainbow of Velaris can be found a hundred
                  galleries, supply stores, potters' compounds, sculpture
                  gardens, and anything in between. In this quarter is located a
                  building with a golden top, the most famous of the five main
                  theaters in the city.

                <p>
                  The Rainbow of Velaris is a kaleidoscope of creativity and
                  life, a vivid reminder of the unyielding spirit of the Night
                  Court. What captivates me most is how it serves as the heart
                  of art and culture in Velaris, a safe haven for dreamers and
                  creators alike. The bustling streets, painted in every
                  imaginable hue, evoke a sense of wonder and endless
                  possibility. It's not just a place—it's a celebration of
                  individuality and expression, where each artist contributes to
                  the symphony of color and magic that makes Velaris so
                  enchanting.

                <p>
                  Rita's is a pleasure hall in Velaris where people can dance
                  and gamble. Rhysand's Inner Circle often frequent this
                  establishment, particularly Morrigan who visits Rita's the
                  most.

                <p>
                  Rita’s bar in Velaris is the epitome of fun and freedom—a
                  place where the weight of the world can be left at the door.
                  What I love most is its lively, carefree atmosphere, where
                  laughter and music fill the air, and even the most stoic
                  hearts can find joy. It’s not just a bar; it’s a sanctuary
                  where friendships are deepened, worries are drowned, and
                  moments of pure, unrestrained celebration come to life. Rita’s
                  is a reminder that even in a world of challenges, there’s
                  always a corner reserved for happiness and connection.
